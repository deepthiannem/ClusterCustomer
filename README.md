## Customer Segmentation and Clustering

### Project Overview

This project aims to understand customer behavior and characteristics through segmentation and clustering techniques. By analyzing mall customer data, we identify patterns and groups among customers based on their purchasing habits and personal attributes. This insight helps in developing targeted marketing strategies and improving customer service.

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of mall customer information compiled into a CSV file. Each record includes the following fields:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Customer's gender (Male/Female)
Age: Customer's age
Annual Income (k$): Customer's annual income in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): Customer's spending score assigned by the mall based on behavior and spending nature

### Methodologies

The project encompasses various data analysis and clustering techniques, structured as follows:

#### Data Exploration

Univariate Analysis: Examines single variables to summarize and find patterns in the data.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigates the relationship between two variables, providing insights into correlations and interactions.

#### Clustering Analysis

Univariate Clustering: Clustering based on single variables to understand the distribution and grouping within individual factors.
Bivariate Clustering: Involves two variables, analyzing the clusters that form based on the interaction between these variables.
Multivariate Clustering: A comprehensive approach considering multiple variables simultaneously to identify more complex patterns and relationships.

### Code and Visualizations

The analysis is conducted using Python, with code and corresponding visualizations embedded within a Jupyter notebook. The notebook is structured to guide the reader through each step of the analysis, with comments and explanations accompanying the code. Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and cluster diagrams, providing intuitive insights into the data and the results of the clustering analysis.

### How to Use

Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook file.
Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Run the cells in sequence to replicate the analysis and view the visualizations.

### Conclusion

Through this project, distinct customer segments were identified based on various attributes and behaviors. These insights can assist in tailoring marketing strategies to specific customer groups, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
